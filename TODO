Fixes:
 ☐ Going Online->Offline is not tracked properly, should update when failing to connect or receiving disconnect signal.
    Looks like presence service stops functioning once there are more services enabled. Looks like the last service always wins - bug in protocol?

First of all:
 ☐ test SST connectivity. 
 ☐ Compare how much of it is done to the spec?

Second:
 ✔ try the file synchronization (SaveDialog) @done (12-10-25 04:53)
 ✔ and how it manages to deliver the chunks. @done (12-10-25 04:53)
 works via Chat Dialog - just drag and drop the file there.

Third:
 ☐ since there is no naming/routing we should limit work to LAN only.

Fourth:
 ☐ synchronize arbitrary file chunks and their metadata between devices in the cluster (hardcoded for start).

Fifth:
 ☐ add features for capturing the data into the system. Agreed to do it Dropbox-style, so need to add and watch a directory.
