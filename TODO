First of all, test SST connectivity. Compare how much of it is done to the spec?
Second, try the file synchronization (SaveDialog) and how it manages to deliver the chunks.
Third, since there is no naming/routing we should limit work to LAN only.
Fourth, synchronize arbitrary file chunks and their metadata between devices in the cluster (hardcoded for start).
Fifth, add features for capturing the data into the system.
