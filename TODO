Fixes:
 ☐ Going Online->Offline is not tracked properly, should update when failing to connect or receiving disconnect signal.

First of all:
 ☐ test SST connectivity. 
 ☐ Compare how much of it is done to the spec?

Second:
 ✔ try the file synchronization (SaveDialog) @done (12-10-25 04:53)
 ✔ and how it manages to deliver the chunks. @done (12-10-25 04:53)
 works via Chat Dialog - just drag and drop the file there.

Third:
 ☐ since there is no naming/routing we should limit work to LAN only.

Fourth:
 ☐ synchronize arbitrary file chunks and their metadata between devices in the cluster (hardcoded for start).
 ☐ sync git-like file trees and chunk blobs
   ☐ split a file into a number of fixed-size blocks (plus a smaller trailing block if necessary)
   ☐ record each block hash into a file record 
   ☐ record metadata block(s), HMAC it/them - should it be fixed size or some more manageable chunks?
   ☐ add metadata block(s) hash(es) into a file record and then HMAC the entire record
   ☐ record each file record into a tree object and HMAC it
   ☐ go up the tree adding subtrees as records, just like git trees, HMAC each tree
   ☐ now since the tree has changed, record a Change, link it to parent Change, sign and HMAC it. - tag HEAD onto the latest change now
   ☐ this is where tree sync will start - other nodes compare their own HEAD changes with this node and perform a sync-fetch to align histories.
      in general case sync doesn't have to bring in all changes of the history, e.g. each Change object lineage may be synced, but for the file blocks
      you only need to know the actual contents of the latest version and where to find the earlier version in case user takes a peek.

Fifth:
 ✔ add features for capturing the data into the system. Agreed to do it Dropbox-style, so need to add and watch a directory. @done (12-12-11 01:37)
