Peering:
 ‚òê "Peer" is a remote contact.
   Peer can have a profile, a set of EIDs, various access rights into our cluster(s).

  peers are concepts in uia::naming namespace.


Peer ::- list of EIDs, profile, list of peers (almost recursively - we don't know their lists of peers)
       ::- with EIDs also list of last known endpoints for those EIDs

This EIDs and endpoints information is also used by the uia::routing layer for DHT.
