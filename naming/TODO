Peering:
 ‚òê "Peer" is a remote contact.
   Peer can have a profile, a set of EIDs, various access rights into our cluster(s).

  peers are concepts in uia::naming namespace.


Peer ::- list of EIDs, profile, list of peers (almost recursively - we don't know their lists of peers)
       ::- with EIDs also list of last known endpoints for those EIDs

This EIDs and endpoints information is also used by the uia::routing layer for DHT.



Urbit:
  Profiles are interesting, you can specify a lot of information about yourself.

  %lord male-identified individual
  %lady female-identified individual
  %punk opaque handle
  %anon totally anonymous
  %home family
  %crew corporation
  %band creative collective
  %fair nonprofit
  %dept government agency
  %holy religious institution

 Also ask for political alignments, profile pic, given name(s), nicknames, family names, CEO, leaders etc.
 Probably look at a Facebook profile? What's relevant there - education, past working places etc.
 You can add this in your profile yourself, but it can also be harvested and filled in by other peers in their instances
 of your profile. The notes they keep and whatever you update never overwrite each other, so it's possible to
 collect information you see relevant.

Plist representation:
  vector<uid> peers; => "peers"
  peer.<uid>.[fields]
