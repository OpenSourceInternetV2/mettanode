Compiling
~~~~~~~~~

* Compilation prerequisites:

	- Qt 4.1.1 (4.1.0 doesn't work due to a QHostAddress bug)
	- OpenSSL 0.9.8 or later (0.9.7e doesn't work)

* Compiling under Unix or Mac OS X:

Once you've installed the packages above, run the supplied 'configure'
script (or just run 'qmake', which is all the configure script really
does), and then type 'make' to build everything.  There's currently no
installation mechanism.

* Compiling under Windows:

You're REALLY sure?  You wouldn't prefer to try Linux, or get a nice Mac?
Okay then...

Here's the way I compile Netsteria under Windows; your mileage may vary.

1. Download the pre-compiled Qt open source release from Trolltech,
   and install it with the MinGW distribution that it knows how to fetch.
   (I have yet to figure out how to install MinGW successfully by itself,
   and Qt doesn't seem to like the version of MinGW built into cygwin.)
   Start the Qt/MinGW command prompt environment via the shortcut provided.

2. Download and extract the openssl-0.9.8d source release from openssl.org,
   then build it as described in the INSTALL.W32 file in the tree.

3. Go to the top of the Netsteria tree, copy 'top.pri.in' to 'top.pri',
   and then edit 'top.pri', replacing:
	@INCS@ with <openssl-path>/outinc
	@LIBS@ with -L<openssl-path>/out
   where <openssl-path> is the top of your compiled OpenSSL source tree.

3. CD to the top level of the Netsteria source tree,
   then type 'qmake' and then 'make'.
   Cross fingers.
