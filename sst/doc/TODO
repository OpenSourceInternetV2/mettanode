SST unfinished business

Most immediate usability necessities:
 ☐ finish implementing wire protocol to specs.  Specifically:
   ☐ receiver-directed flow control
   ☐ datagram reassembly
   ☐ stream attachment and detachment
   ☐ proper stream ID allocation & assignment
   ☐ implement and use sequencing barriers properly (spec 3.4.1)
 ☐ specify and fix negotiation protocol format
 ☐ registration protocol: specify, add explicit deregistration on shutdown
    ☐ would be nice to move registration protocol details to the routing lib if possible?
        move started, but there are still deps on SST::Host

Renaming and restructuring to do at some point (tentative list):
 ☐ Socket -> Network (or -> Adapter?); Channel -> ChannelID (or -> FlowID?)
 ☐ SocketReceiver -> ControlProtocol?
 ☐ Flow -> Channel?
 ☐ StreamTarget -> Target, separate into its own module
 ☐ Message -> Record (e.g., readMesage() -> readRecord)?
     Might help avoid confusion between "Message" and "Datagram".

Qt wishlist for SST:
 ☐ Base64 conversion flags for URL-safe and/or '='-padding free variants.
 ☐ QTimer hooks allowing time virtualization for simulation purposes.
 ☐ Make *Datagram calls in QUdpSocket virtual, or else support custom NetworkProxy extensions for virtualizing the network.
 ☐ Make QAbstractSocket a "real" abstract base class that can be subclassed for reasons other than to wrap a different kind of native socket.
 ☐ Make Qt's signal/slot mechanism handle namespaces in type names properly.
 ☐ Access to OS's path MTU detection facilities under UDP
